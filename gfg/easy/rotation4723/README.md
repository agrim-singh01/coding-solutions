# Find Kth Rotation

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an increasing sorted rotated array  **arr[]** of distinct integers. The array is right-rotated  **k**  times. Find the value of  **k**.
Let's suppose we have an array arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 9], if we rotate it by 2 times it will look like this:
After 1st Rotation : [9, 2, 4, 6]
After 2nd Rotation : [6, 9, 2, 4]

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The given array is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The original sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We can see that the array was rotated 1 times to the right.

```

```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 0
Explanation: The given array is not rotated.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

```java
class Solution {
    public int findKRotation(int arr[]) {
       int low = 0;
       int high = arr.length - 1;
       
       while(low<=high){
           if(arr[low] <= arr[high]){
               return low;
           }
           int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
           if(arr[low] <= arr[mid]){
               low = mid + 1;
           }else{
               high = mid;
           }
       }
       return low;
        
    }
}
```
