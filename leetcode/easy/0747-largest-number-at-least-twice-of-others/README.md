# Largest Number At Least Twice of Others

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is  **unique**.

Determine whether the largest element in the array is  **at least twice**  as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return  *the  **index**  of the largest element, or return* `-1` *otherwise*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer.
For every other number in the array x, 6 is at least twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is less than twice the value of 3, so we return -1.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= nums.length <= 50
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
- The largest element in nums is unique.

        for(int i=0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if(nums[i]>largest){
                secondLargest = largest;
                largest = nums[i];
                largestidx = i;
            }else if(nums[i] > secondLargest && nums[i]<largest){
                secondLargest = nums[i];
            }
        }
        if(largest >=2*secondLargest){
            return largestidx;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
